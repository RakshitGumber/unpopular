# Social Media App README

Welcome to our Social Media App! This app allows users to create posts and engage with each other through comments. Our platform aims to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for connecting and sharing with others.

## Project Overview

Over the course of three weeks, our team embarked on the journey of developing this Social Media App using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Below, we'll highlight the key milestones and components of our development process.

### Week 1: Planning and Setup

During the first week, we focused on planning and setting up the project environment. This involved:

- **Project Planning:** We defined the app's features, user stories, and technical requirements. This step helped us establish a clear vision for the project and prioritize tasks.
- **Environment Setup:** We set up the development environment by installing necessary tools and frameworks, including Node.js, npm, MongoDB, and React.
- **Backend Development:** We started building the backend infrastructure using Node.js and Express.js. This included setting up routes, controllers, and models for handling user authentication, posts, and comments.

### Week 2: Frontend Development

In the second week, our focus shifted to frontend development, where we built the user interface using React. Key tasks during this phase included:

- **UI Design:** We designed the layout and user interface components using modern UI frameworks like Material-UI or Bootstrap, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.
- **Integration with Backend:** We integrated the frontend with the backend APIs, allowing users to interact with the server to fetch and submit data seamlessly.
- **State Management:** We implemented state management using tools like Redux or React Context API to manage application state and handle data flow between components.

### Week 3: Testing and Deployment

The final week was dedicated to testing and deployment, ensuring the app is stable and ready for production. This involved:

- **Unit and Integration Testing:** We conducted thorough testing of both frontend and backend components to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
- **User Acceptance Testing:** We engaged with beta users to gather feedback and make necessary improvements based on their experiences.
- **Deployment:** Finally, we deployed the app to a hosting platform like Heroku or AWS, making it accessible to users worldwide.

## Getting Started

To get started with our Social Media App, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the project repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using `npm install` for both frontend and backend.
3. **Set Up Environment Variables:** Configure environment variables for the backend, including MongoDB connection URI and JWT secret.
4. **Run the App:** Start the backend server using `npm start` in the backend directory, and start the frontend development server using `npm run start` in the frontend directory.
5. **Explore the App:** Once the servers are running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to explore the Social Media App.
